# Python-Small-Tools
A collection of practical Python small tools for daily use and basic development practice, all tools are **lightweight, runnable and with simple UI prototype design (PS/AI)**. Focus on solving actual small problems and improving Python development ability.
> All tools are independent of each other, with clear running steps and code comments, easy to use and secondary development.

## 🛠️ Tool Repository Structure
Classified by functional scenarios, each tool has an independent directory (including code file, README and design files, to be filled in).
- File-Processing/
    Batch-Rename/
    Format-Conversion/
    File-Filter/
- Data-Processing/
    Excel-CSV-Handle/
    Data-Cleaning/
    Simple-Analysis/
- Web-Crawler/
    Simple-Crawler/
    Wallpaper-Crawler/
    Book-List-Crawler/
- Daily-Tools/
    To-Do-List/
    Simple-Calculator/
    Password-Generator/

## 🎯 Development Objective
- Master Python basic development (file I/O, network request, data processing, etc.);
- Cultivate the ability to solve actual small problems with code;
- Combine PS/AI design skills to complete the visual design of small tools (UI prototype, interface display);
- Accumulate reusable code snippets and development experience for future complex project development.

## 🎨 UI/Visual Design (PS/AI Integration)
Combine design skills with tool development to achieve "function + vision" dual presentation:
- Design **simple UI prototypes** for each tool with Illustrator (including function layout, interface interaction);
- Make high-definition running interface screenshots for each tool with Photoshop (typesetting and optimization);
- Store design files (AI/PNG) in the corresponding tool directory, associated with code files;
- Optimize the display effect of the tool's running results to improve the usability of the tool.

## 🔧 Development Environment & Dependencies
- Python Version: 3.8+ (recommended)
- Common Dependencies: requests, pandas, openpyxl, beautifulsoup4 (to be added in each tool's README)
- Design Tools: Photoshop, Illustrator (for UI prototype and visual design)
- Running Environment: Windows/macOS/Linux (cross-platform compatible as much as possible)

## 📝 Tool Development Standard
1. Each tool is independent, with a single function and clear logic (code lines: 50-500);
2. The code is with standard comments (key logic and function explanation);
3. Each tool has its own detailed README (running steps, environment requirements, effect display);
4. With design files (UI prototype/screenshot) and running effect display.

## 📈 Update Plan
- Develop 1 small function every day (complete one tool module in 3-5 days);
- Supplement design files and running documentation while developing the tool;
- Optimize the existing tool code and design effect regularly (1 per week).

## 📌 For Job & Cooperation
These small tools reflect my **practical Python development ability and problem-solving thinking**, and the integration of design skills makes the tools more complete in presentation. I am open to cooperating in the development of lightweight Python tools and the visual design of small projects.
